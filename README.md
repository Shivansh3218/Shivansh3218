# üí´ About Me:
I'am from Srinagar Garhwal Uttarakhand ,I switched after graduating in Biochemistry to a Frontend developer. Seeing how a person can grow in the software industry if he/she puts efforts. Learning coding was a thing I always fascinated I was curious how people design these application that simply make our life better, now I feel incredibly enthusiastic that I was able to learn and implement that knowledge in making real time projects .<br><br>I've spent around 9 months in a bootcamp practicing and implementing core concepts of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux and learning several libraries like Bootstrap, Material UI, Ant Designs, react-charts. I love to study these frameworks and implement my own imagination to develop projects . Looking forward to learn more programming languages and frameworks.<br><br>Working with these has been an incredible experience and completing every project was an oddly satisfying feeling and as my speciality involves learning quickly and debugging also at the same time I think I can improve a lot.
