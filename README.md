# üí´ About Me:
I'am from Srinagar Garhwal Uttarakhand ,I switched after graduating in Biochemistry to a Frontend developer. Seeing how a person can grow in the software industry if he/she puts efforts. Learning coding was a thing I always fascinated I was curious how people design these application that simply make our life better, now I feel incredibly enthusiastic that I was able to learn and implement that knowledge in making real time projects .<br><br>I've spent around 9 months in a bootcamp practicing and implementing core concepts of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux and learning several libraries like Bootstrap, Material UI, Ant Designs, react-charts. I love to study these frameworks and implement my own imagination to develop projects . Looking forward to learn more programming languages and frameworks.<br>
